    "* Set up a package for EBMs using `PkgTemplates`. Include CI using GitHub Actions and set up a remote repository on GitHub. In the rest of the exercise, create a new branch for each part of the exercise and practice branching and merging (including merging both locally, from the command line, and via a PR on GitHub). Make sure to write tests for all of your functions. Can you see the tests passing on GitHub Actions?\n",
    "* Add functions for all zero-dimensional EBMs talked about in the lecture. Include tests that they all result in fixed points.\n",
    "* How do the fixed points change if you use Budyko's approach for the outgoing radiation?\n",
    "* Can you think of another ansatz to model a temperature dependend albedo? The albedo has to exhibit realistic values for given temperatures, as given in the lecture or on Wikipedia (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Albedo-e_hg.svg). Include it in your package and investigate its dynamics."
