When $H$ is the amount of hares, and $F$ is the amount of foxes, then their population dynamics are described by \n",

For a system as \"easy\" as the LV, you will probably not see large differences in accuracy, but note and compare their different performance with `@btime` from `BenchmarkTools.jl`. Also experiment with how the adaptive stepsize tolerances like `reltol` (default: $10^{-3}$) and `abstol` (default: $10^{-6}$) influence the performance of the solver \n",

    "* `Rosenbrock23()` is a different kind of solver. It is an implicit solver that is different to the explicit Runge-Kutta and Euler solvers we talked about. It is setup to deal with \"stiff\" ODEs. Stiff ODEs are numerically harder to solve. They occur e.g. when there is a large difference in scale between the different dimensions of a system/model. They can also solve non-stiff ODEs, but generally they are slower than the explicit solvers for these cases (for a similar accuracy). "
