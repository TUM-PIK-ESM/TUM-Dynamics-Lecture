    "Julia has one major plotting library `Plots.jl` that can use different backends for plotting (like Python's matplotlib or plotly). After importing the library with `using Plots`, a basic plot is called by `plot(x,y)`. If you want to add to an exisiting plot, use `plot!(x,y)`. You can adjust the plot by adding keyword arguments. Some common keyword arguments are: \n",

    "* `ylabel`\n",

    "\n",
    "For those how are familiar with Python, you can also use `matplotlib.pyplot` directly, there is a Julia wrapper, called `PyPlot.jl`. The syntax is almost the same as in Python. See its documentation (https://github.com/JuliaPy/PyPlot.jl) for how exactly it translates. \n",
