    "# Exercise 9\n",
    "\n",
    "* Add the Ghil Sellers EBM to your EBM package from Exercise 8 or create a new package for it \n",
    "* For initial conditions of the type `T_0 * ones(n)`, at which value `T_0` is the basin boundary between the cold and warm state of the system, try to estimate it correctly up to one digit after the decimal point.\n",
    "* Also implement a fourth order central difference scheme and try the same basin boundary estimation again, you can look up the coefficients on [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Finite_difference_coefficient)\n",
    "* Add an additional modifier $\\mu$ to the outgoing radition, so that for $\\mu=1$ the radiation stays the same \n",
    "* Do a bifurcation diagram similar to the one demonstrated in Lecture 8, in which you take $\\mu$ as the control parameter and vary it within $\\mu \\in [0.95;1.02]$ in small steps for various initial condtions and track how the average temperature of the final state changes and when both a cold and a warm state coexist. \n",
    "* Use the performance tips from the second part of the lecture to further optimize the code, focus e.g. on the `struct`s and their types"
