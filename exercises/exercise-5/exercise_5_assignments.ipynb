    "## 1. Optimal Embeddings and Lyapunov Exponents\n",
    "The [Rössler system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/R%C3%B6ssler_attractor) is a three-dimensional continuous-time nonlinear dynamical system with chaotic dynamics similar to the Lorenz system. The equations of motion are,\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\begin{aligned} \\frac{dx}{dt} & = -y - z \\\\ \\frac{dy}{dt} & = x + ay \\\\ \\frac{dz}{dt} & = b + z(x-c) \\end{aligned}$$\n",

    "1. Compute a trajectory of the Rössler system with the default parameters in DynamicalSystems.jl and plot the attractor in the $x-y$, $x-z$, and $y-z$ planes.\n",
    "2. Create a one-dimensional time series from this trajectory by keeping only the first dimension.\n",
    "3. Given your one-dimensional time series, use the `optimal_separated_de` routine from DynamicalSystems.jl to estimate the optimal embedding dimension and delays for the Rössler system.\n",
    "4. Use the optimal embedding to estimate the Lyapunov exponent of the Rössler system using the methods `lyapunov_from_data` and `linear_region`, as shown in the lecture. Remember to plot $E(k) - E(0)$ versus $k \\times \\Delta t$. How does your estimate compare to the true Lyapunov exponent? Discuss your answer."
