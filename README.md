# Modelling and Machine Learning of Dynamical Systems in Julia 

This repository collects material from the course given at Technical University Munich. 

The course teaches the basics of dynamical systems theory and scientific programming. For this purpose, the Julia programming language is used and it is shown how scientific code can be written in it. Aside from the language itself, good programming practices like version control and programming environments are introduced. Aside from that the course is focussed on differential equations, their properties and how they can be numerically solved. This knowledge is then used to further explore chaotic dynamical systems and look into applications e.g. in climate modelling and epidemiology. In the last part of the lecture, the focus is on recent research on combining dynamical systems with machine learning, both for data analysis and improving the modelling itself. 

Slides for the first part of the lecture are partially on Google Slides with links given here in the repository.
